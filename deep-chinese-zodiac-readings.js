    Rat: {
        title: "Year of the Rat",
        archetype: "The Clever Survivor",
        hook: "Born in the Year of the Rat, this soul carries the energy of the clever survivor - the first animal in the zodiac cycle, representing new beginnings, initiative, and the intelligence to thrive in any circumstance. Rats are the opportunists of the zodiac, finding openings where others see walls.",
        coreNature: `The Rat embodies the archetype of the resourceful pioneer. There's a natural intelligence that goes beyond book learning - it's street-smart, adaptive, and always aware of opportunities. Rats have an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time, not through luck but through sharp observation and quick thinking.

This is a soul who understands survival at its deepest level. Not just physical survival, but thriving in competitive environments, navigating complex social situations, and building security through wit and charm. The Rat's mind is always working, always planning, always several steps ahead.`,
        
        strengths: `Rats possess remarkable intelligence and adaptability. Their minds work quickly, spotting patterns and opportunities that others miss entirely. This quick thinking is paired with genuine charm - Rats know how to work a room, how to make connections, how to open doors through personal magnetism.

There's a natural business acumen here. Rats understand value, whether it's in relationships, opportunities, or literal finances. They're excellent at accumulating resources and even better at using those resources strategically. Their survival instincts are impeccable.

Socially, Rats are engaging and witty. They have stories to tell, connections to make, and a way of making themselves indispensable. Their loyalty to their chosen circle is fierce, and they'll use all their considerable cleverness to protect and advance their people.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Rat energy can manifest as opportunism that crosses into manipulation. That sharp mind that spots opportunities can also calculate how to exploit situations or people. There's a risk of being too transactional, seeing everything in terms of advantage gained or lost.

Restlessness plagues many Rats. The same quick mind that's such an asset can also create constant dissatisfaction, always looking for the next thing, the better deal, the greener grass. This can prevent them from fully appreciating what they have.

Criticism can be an issue - Rats see flaws as quickly as they see opportunities. This can make them harsh judges of others and themselves. The survival instinct that serves them so well can also manifest as anxiety or hoarding behavior, unable to ever feel truly secure.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Rats are devoted to their inner circle while maintaining a wide social network. They understand that relationships are resources, but for those they truly care about, the generosity is genuine. Rats are excellent providers and protectors, using all their cleverness to benefit their loved ones.

Romance with a Rat is never boring. They bring wit, spontaneity, and a kind of playful intelligence to partnerships. They need partners who can keep up mentally and who appreciate cleverness. Loyalty is extremely important - betray a Rat and that sharp mind becomes focused on revenge or cutting you out completely.

Family is central to most Rats. They're often the ones who keep everyone connected, who remember important occasions, who build and maintain the family network. They want to leave a legacy and provide security for future generations.`,
        
        career: `Rats excel in business, sales, and any field where quick thinking and social intelligence matter. They're natural entrepreneurs, always spotting gaps in the market or ways to improve existing systems. Their combination of charm and shrewdness makes them formidable negotiators.

Fields like finance, real estate, law, or consulting appeal to the Rat's strategic mind. They're also excellent in roles that require networking or relationship building. Their ability to spot talent and build teams makes them effective leaders, though their quick pace can frustrate slower colleagues.

The key career challenge for Rats is staying engaged. They need variety, challenge, and opportunities to use their cleverness. Routine or bureaucracy can be soul-crushing. They need roles where quick thinking and adaptability are assets.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Rats often involves learning to trust in abundance rather than operating from scarcity. Despite their skill at accumulating resources, many Rats secretly fear there won't be enough. Spiritual growth comes from releasing this fear and trusting in the flow.

Learning to value stillness and presence is another key lesson. The Rat's quick mind is always racing ahead, but wisdom often comes in moments of quiet. Meditation, contemplation, or any practice that slows the mental chatter can be transformative.

There's also a lesson around discernment versus criticism. The Rat's sharp eye can be used for judgment or for compassionate understanding. Spiritual maturity involves using that intelligence to see the bigger picture, not just the flaws and opportunities.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Rat years are times of new beginnings and opportunities. The energy supports initiative, strategic thinking, and building foundations for future success. It's a year to be alert, to network, to spot openings and act on them quickly.

For those born in Rat years, the 12-year zodiac cycle brings particular intensity. Every 12 years, when the Rat returns, there's an opportunity for renewal and reinvention. These are powerful years for setting new directions.`,
        
        compatibility: `Rats find natural harmony with Dragons and Monkeys - together they form a triangle of intelligence and ambition. Dragon provides the vision and confidence, Monkey the creativity and wit, and Rat the strategy and resourcefulness.

Oxen can be good partners for Rats - the Ox provides stability and patience while the Rat brings adaptability and social skills. Pigs share the Rat's love of good living and can provide warmth and trust.

Challenging matches include Horses (too independent and impulsive for the strategic Rat) and Roosters (too critical and rigid). Rabbits might seem too passive or indecisive for the quick-moving Rat.`,
        
        affirmation: "I trust in my intelligence and resourcefulness. Opportunities flow to me naturally, and I have everything I need. My quick mind is a gift I use with wisdom and compassion."

    Ox: {
        title: "Year of the Ox",
        archetype: "The Steadfast Builder",
        hook: "Born in the Year of the Ox, this soul carries the energy of the steadfast builder - patient, reliable, and possessed of quiet strength that moves mountains through consistent effort. The Ox represents the power of dedication and the rewards that come to those who work diligently.",
        coreNature: `The Ox embodies the archetype of the patient builder. This is strength that doesn't need to announce itself, power that comes from determination rather than flash. Oxen understand that great things are built slowly, brick by brick, day by day.

There's an inner stability that's almost unshakeable. Where others might be swayed by trends or temporary setbacks, the Ox plods forward, focused on the long-term goal. This isn't stubbornness (though it can manifest that way) - it's profound faith in the value of sustained effort.

The Ox soul came here to demonstrate the power of responsibility. They're the ones who show up, who do what needs to be done regardless of recognition or praise. Their work ethic isn't performative; it's simply how they operate in the world.`,
        
        strengths: `Oxen possess remarkable reliability and determination. When they commit to something, they see it through. This makes them invaluable in any situation requiring sustained effort or dependability. Their word means something; promises made are promises kept.

There's a physical and mental strength here that's impressive. Oxen can carry heavy loads - whether literal or metaphorical - without complaint. They have endurance that outlasts flashier competitors. While others burn out, the Ox keeps going.

Practically speaking, Oxen are often skilled with their hands and have a natural understanding of how things work. They're methodical problem-solvers who prefer proven methods over untested innovations. Their patience allows them to master complex skills that require sustained practice.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Ox energy manifests as rigidity and resistance to change. That same steadiness that's such a strength can become an unwillingness to adapt when adaptation is needed. Oxen can get stuck in patterns that no longer serve them, continuing simply because "that's how it's always been done."

Stubbornness is a real issue for many Oxen. Once they've made up their mind, changing it can be nearly impossible, even in the face of compelling evidence. This can lead to missed opportunities or persistence in the wrong direction.

Emotional expression can be challenging. Oxen feel deeply but often don't know how to articulate or share those feelings. This can lead to relationships where partners feel shut out, not realizing the depth of feeling that exists beneath the stoic exterior.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Oxen are loyal and devoted. They might not be the most demonstrative, but their commitment runs bone-deep. They show love through actions more than words - providing, protecting, doing the work that keeps life stable.

Romance with an Ox requires patience. They're not quick to trust or open up, but once they do, they're in it for the long haul. They need partners who understand that silence doesn't mean absence of feeling, and who appreciate devotion over grand romantic gestures.

As parents or family members, Oxen are the backbone. They're the ones who handle responsibilities, who provide stability, who can be counted on in crisis. They may struggle with emotional availability but their dedication to family welfare is absolute.`,
        
        career: `Oxen excel in careers requiring sustained effort and reliability. Agriculture, construction, craftsmanship, engineering - fields where patient work produces tangible results. They're excellent in roles requiring attention to detail and consistent quality.

Management positions suit Oxen well when they can focus on systems and processes rather than constant innovation. They build solid, efficient operations. However, they may struggle in fast-paced environments requiring rapid adaptation or in roles demanding high social interaction.

The key career satisfaction for Oxen comes from seeing concrete results of their efforts. They need to know their work matters and produces real value. Recognition is appreciated but not required - they'll keep working well without it.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Oxen often involves learning to balance strength with flexibility. The lesson is that true strength includes the ability to bend when necessary, to adapt while maintaining core integrity. Learning when to persist and when to pivot is crucial growth.

Emotional opening is another key lesson. Oxen came here to learn that vulnerability isn't weakness. Allowing others to see their feelings, to share burdens, to be supported rather than always being the supporter - this is advanced work for Ox souls.

There's also a lesson around rest and renewal. Oxen can work themselves to exhaustion, believing that their value lies in their productivity. Learning to rest without guilt, to appreciate life beyond work, is transformative spiritual work.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Ox years are times of building and consolidation. The energy supports hard work, planning, and laying foundations. Progress may feel slow, but what's built during Ox years tends to last. It's a year for patience and sustained effort.

For those born in Ox years, the 12-year zodiac cycle brings periods of intensive building. Every 12 years offers an opportunity to assess what's been built and recommit to long-term goals with renewed dedication.`,
        
        compatibility: `Oxen find natural harmony with Snakes and Roosters - together they form a triangle of dedication and precision. Snake provides depth and intuition, Rooster the standards and attention to detail, and Ox the strength and follow-through.

Rats can be good partners - the Rat's cleverness complements the Ox's steadiness. Pigs share the Ox's appreciation for material security and can bring warmth to the relationship.

Challenging matches include Goats (too scattered and dependent for the self-sufficient Ox) and Horses (too restless and freedom-loving for the stability-seeking Ox). Tigers might seem too impulsive and chaotic.`,
        
        affirmation: "My steady efforts create lasting value. I honor both my strength and my softness. I am flexible within my strength, adapting wisely while maintaining my core integrity."
    },

    Tiger: {
        title: "Year of the Tiger",
        archetype: "The Fearless Leader",
        hook: "Born in the Year of the Tiger, this soul carries the energy of the fearless leader - bold, charismatic, and magnetically powerful. Tigers represent raw courage, the willingness to take risks, and the kind of presence that commands attention without trying.",
        coreNature: `The Tiger embodies the archetype of the brave warrior. This is courage personified - not the absence of fear but the willingness to act despite it. Tigers came here to demonstrate that bold action creates change and that leadership requires the courage to stand alone when necessary.

There's a magnetic quality to Tiger energy. When they walk into a room, people notice. This isn't performance; it's authentic power. Tigers radiate confidence and vitality. They're here to live large, take risks, and inspire others through their example.

The Tiger soul understands instinctively that life is meant to be lived fully. Caution might be wise, but excessive caution kills the spirit. Tigers would rather fail spectacularly in pursuit of something great than succeed at something small and safe.`,
        
        strengths: `Tigers possess natural leadership and charisma. People are drawn to their confidence and energy. They have a gift for inspiring others and rallying people to causes. Their enthusiasm is contagious and their courage authentic.

There's a competitive fire that drives Tigers to excellence. They're not content with mediocrity - they want to be the best, to push boundaries, to achieve remarkable things. This competitive nature, channeled well, produces extraordinary accomplishments.

Tigers are also fiercely protective of those they love. Their courage extends to standing up for others, fighting injustice, and defending the vulnerable. They're noble in their way, with a strong sense of honor and fairness.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Tiger energy manifests as recklessness and arrogance. That bold confidence can cross into hubris, believing they're invincible or that rules don't apply to them. This can lead to unnecessary risks or trampling others in pursuit of goals.

Impulsiveness is a constant challenge. Tigers act on instinct, which is sometimes brilliant but sometimes disastrous. They may leap before looking, start projects they don't finish, or make commitments their enthusiasm can't sustain.

Authority issues plague many Tigers. They resist being told what to do and may rebel against structures or rules they see as limiting. While independence is strength, excessive rebellion can create unnecessary conflict and missed opportunities.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Tigers are passionate and intense. They love with the same fierce energy they bring to everything. Romance with a Tiger is an adventure - exciting, unpredictable, and never boring. They're generous with attention and affection when engaged.

However, Tigers need independence within relationships. They require partners who can handle their intensity without trying to tame it, who support their ambitions without being threatened. Jealous or controlling partners will find themselves in constant conflict.

As parents or family members, Tigers are protective and encouraging. They teach courage and independence. They may struggle with the patience required for mundane caregiving tasks but excel at inspiring and defending their people.`,
        
        career: `Tigers excel in leadership positions, entrepreneurship, and any field where courage and charisma matter. They're natural at sales, entertainment, politics, or military leadership. They need roles where they can be visible and make an impact.

The corporate world can frustrate Tigers unless they're at the top. They struggle with bureaucracy and authority. They need autonomy, challenge, and opportunities to prove themselves. Routine or subordinate positions feel like cages.

The key career satisfaction for Tigers comes from achievement and recognition. They need to feel they're accomplishing something significant, making their mark on the world. Impact matters more than security.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Tigers often involves learning to balance courage with wisdom. The lesson is that true strength includes knowing when not to fight, when to retreat strategically, when to conserve energy. Wisdom is knowing which battles matter.

Patience is another crucial lesson. Tigers want everything now, but some things require slow cultivation. Learning to sustain effort over time, to work steadily toward distant goals, builds spiritual maturity.

There's also a lesson around vulnerability and surrender. Tigers are so identified with strength that admitting weakness or asking for help feels impossible. Learning that these too require courage - perhaps the deepest courage - is transformative.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Tiger years are times of bold action and new initiatives. The energy supports courage, leadership, and taking calculated risks. It's a year when brave moves can pay off spectacularly, but impulsiveness can also backfire. The key is channeling the Tiger's courage wisely.

For those born in Tiger years, the 12-year zodiac cycle brings opportunities for reinvention and fresh starts. Every 12 years offers a chance to leap into something new with renewed courage.`,
        
        compatibility: `Tigers find natural harmony with Horses and Dogs - together they form a triangle of action and loyalty. Horse provides adventure and freedom, Dog the loyalty and integrity, and Tiger the courage and leadership.

Dragons can be interesting but competitive partners - two powerful energies that can either inspire each other or clash. Pigs can provide grounding and appreciation that Tigers need.

Challenging matches include Monkeys (too tricky and indirect for the straightforward Tiger) and Snakes (too secretive and strategic versus the Tiger's bold directness). Oxen might seem too slow and conventional.`,
        
        affirmation: "I am courageous and wise. My boldness is balanced by discernment. I lead with integrity and inspire through authentic strength. I know when to fight and when to rest."
    },

    Rabbit: {
        title: "Year of the Rabbit",
        archetype: "The Graceful Diplomat",
        hook: "Born in the Year of the Rabbit, this soul carries the energy of the graceful diplomat - elegant, sensitive, and naturally gifted at creating harmony. Rabbits represent refinement, good fortune, and the power of gentleness in a harsh world.",
        coreNature: `The Rabbit embodies the archetype of the peaceful mediator. This is intelligence operating through grace rather than force, power expressed through subtlety and social finesse. Rabbits understand that true strength often wears a soft face.

There's an innate sensitivity that makes Rabbits highly attuned to their environment and the people around them. They pick up on subtle social cues, reading emotional undercurrents with remarkable accuracy. This makes them excellent at navigating complex social situations and avoiding unnecessary conflict.

The Rabbit soul came here to demonstrate that beauty, kindness, and diplomacy are not weaknesses but sophisticated forms of strength. They're living proof that you can succeed through grace rather than aggression.`,
        
        strengths: `Rabbits possess exceptional social intelligence and diplomatic skills. They know how to say the right thing, how to smooth over conflicts, how to make everyone feel comfortable. This makes them valuable in any setting requiring tact and relationship management.

There's a natural elegance and refined taste. Rabbits appreciate beauty in all forms - art, music, design, nature. They have a gift for creating beautiful environments and often possess artistic talents themselves. Their aesthetic sense is impeccable.

Compassion and empathy are genuine strengths. Rabbits truly care about others' well-being and will work to ensure everyone is comfortable and cared for. Their kindness isn't strategic; it's sincere. This creates deep loyalty in relationships.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Rabbit energy manifests as excessive conflict avoidance. That diplomatic nature can become people-pleasing, agreeing to things they don't want to avoid confrontation. This can lead to resentment and loss of authenticity.

Over-sensitivity is a real challenge. Rabbits can be easily hurt by criticism or harsh environments. What others brush off can wound them deeply. This can lead to withdrawal or anxiety in situations requiring thick skin.

Indecision plagues many Rabbits. Their ability to see all sides of a situation can make it hard to choose. Fear of making the wrong decision can lead to paralysis or relying too heavily on others to decide for them.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Rabbits are devoted and romantic. They create beautiful, harmonious partnerships and will work hard to maintain peace. They're attentive to their partner's needs and feelings, often anticipating them before they're expressed.

Romance with a Rabbit is gentle and refined. They appreciate beauty, sentiment, and emotional connection. They need partners who are kind, who provide security, and who appreciate their sensitive nature. Harsh or aggressive partners are deeply incompatible.

As parents or family members, Rabbits are nurturing and protective. They create warm, beautiful homes and prioritize their family's emotional well-being. They may struggle with necessary discipline, preferring to avoid conflict even when boundaries are needed.`,
        
        career: `Rabbits excel in careers involving diplomacy, design, counseling, or the arts. They're natural at human resources, public relations, interior design, or any field where aesthetic sense and people skills matter. They create harmony in any workplace.

Highly competitive or conflict-heavy environments are draining for Rabbits. They prefer cooperative workplaces with clear expectations and respectful interactions. They can be effective leaders through their ability to build consensus and inspire loyalty.

The key career satisfaction for Rabbits comes from creating beauty or harmony and working in environments that feel safe and respectful. They need to feel their work contributes to making the world more beautiful or peaceful.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Rabbits often involves learning to balance sensitivity with resilience. The lesson is that staying open-hearted doesn't require absorbing everyone's pain or avoiding all conflict. Healthy boundaries protect sensitivity rather than harden it.

Developing confidence in their own judgment is another key lesson. Rabbits can be too dependent on others' approval or opinions. Learning to trust their own perceptions and make decisions from their center is crucial growth.

There's also a lesson around embracing temporary discomfort for long-term growth. Rabbits naturally avoid anything unpleasant, but some of life's most important experiences require moving through difficulty. Learning to be brave in their own gentle way is transformative.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Rabbit years are times of peace, diplomacy, and gentle progress. The energy supports relationship building, artistic pursuits, and creating beauty. It's a year for harmony and refinement rather than bold action. Progress comes through cooperation and grace.

For those born in Rabbit years, the 12-year zodiac cycle brings opportunities for renewal and finding peace. Every 12 years offers a chance to release conflict and return to their natural grace.`,
        
        compatibility: `Rabbits find natural harmony with Goats and Pigs - together they form a triangle of peace and creativity. Goat provides artistic vision, Pig the warmth and generosity, and Rabbit the diplomacy and grace.

Dogs can be good partners, providing the security and loyalty Rabbits crave. Snakes offer interesting depth, though the Snake's intensity might sometimes overwhelm.

Challenging matches include Roosters (too critical and direct for the sensitive Rabbit) and Rats (too opportunistic and strategic versus the Rabbit's sincerity). Tigers might seem too aggressive and confrontational.`,
        
        affirmation: "I am graceful and strong. My sensitivity is wisdom, not weakness. I create harmony while honoring my truth. I am brave in my own gentle way."
    },

    Dragon: {
        title: "Year of the Dragon",
        archetype: "The Magnificent Achiever",
        hook: "Born in the Year of the Dragon, this soul carries the energy of the mythical beast - powerful, fortunate, and seemingly destined for extraordinary things. Dragons represent the pinnacle of yang energy, the force of greatness made manifest.",
        coreNature: `The Dragon embodies the archetype of the destined leader. This is magnitude personified - natural charisma, exceptional confidence, and an expectation of success that often becomes self-fulfilling. Dragons don't just want to succeed; they expect to excel.

There's a quality of magic around Dragon energy. They seem to attract good fortune, opportunities, and attention. This isn't purely luck - it's the result of their magnetic presence and the high expectations they carry. The universe seems to respond to their certainty.

The Dragon soul came here to demonstrate the power of confidence and vision. They're living proof that great expectations can create great realities, that believing in your own magnificence can actually make you magnificent.`,
        
        strengths: `Dragons possess extraordinary charisma and natural leadership. When they speak, people listen. When they have a vision, others want to follow. This magnetic quality makes them powerful forces in any field they choose to enter.

There's a genuine confidence that's compelling rather than off-putting (when balanced). Dragons believe in their abilities and potential, which gives them courage to attempt things others wouldn't dream of. This often leads to remarkable achievements.

Generosity is another Dragon strength. When successful (which they often are), they're typically generous with their resources, time, and influence. They enjoy being able to help others and make grand gestures. Their leadership often includes lifting others up.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Dragon energy manifests as arrogance and entitlement. That natural confidence can cross into believing they're superior to others, that normal rules don't apply to them, or that they deserve success without effort.

Intolerance is a real issue for many Dragons. They can be impatient with weakness, incompetence, or indecision in others. Their high standards, while driving their own excellence, can make them harsh judges of people who don't match their pace or ambition.

Unrealistic expectations create problems. Dragons can dream so big that they set themselves up for disappointment, or refuse to deal with mundane necessities because they're "above" such things. Learning to balance vision with practical reality is crucial.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Dragons are passionate and generous. They love grandly, with dramatic gestures and intense commitment. Romance with a Dragon is exciting - they bring energy, adventure, and a certain glamour to partnerships.

However, Dragons need admiration within relationships. They require partners who appreciate their magnificence and provide appropriate acknowledgment. They also need intellectual equals - Dragons get bored with partners who can't match them mentally.

As parents or family members, Dragons are proud and encouraging. They have high expectations for their loved ones but also provide opportunities and support. They may struggle with seeing their children as individuals rather than extensions of themselves.`,
        
        career: `Dragons excel in high-profile leadership positions, entrepreneurship, entertainment, or any field where they can make a big impact. They're natural at positions requiring vision, charisma, and the courage to take big swings. They need to be at or near the top.

Subordinate or routine positions are torture for Dragons. They need autonomy, challenge, and opportunities to shine. They're often successful in starting their own enterprises or rising quickly through organizational ranks.

The key career satisfaction for Dragons comes from achievement, recognition, and making a significant impact. They need to feel their work matters on a large scale. Small, invisible work feels like a waste of their potential.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Dragons often involves learning true humility - not false modesty, but genuine understanding that they're magnificent AND human. The lesson is that their worth isn't conditional on achievement or recognition.

Patience is another crucial lesson. Dragons want immediate results and can burn out or give up when success doesn't come quickly. Learning to persist through the mundane middle parts of any journey builds spiritual depth.

There's also a lesson around service. Dragons can get so focused on their own grand visions that they lose sight of simple ways to help others. Learning that small acts of kindness are also forms of greatness is transformative.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Dragon years are times of bold ambition and spectacular achievement. The energy supports big dreams, taking risks, and aiming high. It's a year when fortune favors the brave and when dramatic progress is possible. Think big during Dragon years.

For those born in Dragon years, the 12-year zodiac cycle brings opportunities for reinvention and major breakthroughs. Every 12 years offers a chance to step into greater magnificence.`,
        
        compatibility: `Dragons find natural harmony with Rats and Monkeys - together they form a triangle of intelligence and ambition. Rat provides strategy, Monkey the creativity, and Dragon the vision and confidence.

Roosters can be good partners, providing the details and standards Dragons need support with. Snakes offer interesting depth and mystery that can fascinate Dragons.

Challenging matches include Dogs (too cynical and critical for the confident Dragon) and other Dragons (too much competing for the spotlight). Rabbits might seem too passive or cautious.`,
        
        affirmation: "I am magnificent and humble. My confidence inspires others. I achieve great things while honoring the sacredness of small things. I am both powerful and kind."
    },

    Snake: {
        title: "Year of the Snake",
        archetype: "The Wise Mystic",
        hook: "Born in the Year of the Snake, this soul carries the energy of the wise sage - intuitive, elegant, and delightfully enigmatic. Snakes represent wisdom, transformation, and the power of deep understanding.",
        coreNature: `The Snake embodies the archetype of the mystic wisdom-keeper. This is intelligence that operates in the depths - psychological, intuitive, and profoundly perceptive. Snakes see beneath surfaces, understand hidden motivations, and perceive patterns others miss entirely.

There's a quality of mystery that's intrinsic to Snake energy. Even when they share information, there's a sense of depths not yet revealed. This isn't deception; it's natural privacy and the understanding that some truths can't be spoken, only experienced.

The Snake soul came here to demonstrate the power of transformation and depth. They're living proof that wisdom comes from looking inward, that the greatest journey is through one's own psyche, and that true power is often quiet.`,
        
        strengths: `Snakes possess remarkable intuition and psychological insight. They understand people at a deep level, often knowing what someone feels or wants before it's articulated. This makes them powerful in any situation requiring psychological understanding.

There's a natural elegance and refined taste. Snakes appreciate quality over quantity, depth over breadth. They have discriminating tastes and often possess a sophisticated aesthetic sense. Their presence has a kind of magnetic allure.

Determination is a Snake strength that's often underestimated. That calm exterior hides an iron will. Once Snakes decide on something, they pursue it with quiet, relentless focus. They're patient strategists who play the long game.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Snake energy manifests as jealousy and possessiveness. Their intensity in relationships can become controlling or suspicious. The same perceptiveness that's a gift can become paranoia, seeing threats that don't exist.

Secretiveness can be excessive. While privacy is healthy, Snakes can become so hidden that authentic connection becomes impossible. They may withhold information as a form of power or protection, which creates distance in relationships.

Vindictiveness is a real shadow. Snakes remember slights and can hold grudges. If betrayed or wounded, they can be coldly strategic in their revenge. Learning forgiveness and letting go is crucial spiritual work.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Snakes are devoted and intense. They love deeply, even if they don't always express it obviously. Romance with a Snake is transformative - they offer depth, passion, and a kind of soulful connection that's rare.

However, Snakes need absolute trust and loyalty. Betrayal is unforgivable. They require partners who can handle their intensity, respect their need for privacy, and won't be threatened by their natural magnetism.

As parents or family members, Snakes are protective and insightful. They understand their loved ones at deep levels and can provide profound guidance. They may struggle with being overprotective or withholding affection.`,
        
        career: `Snakes excel in careers requiring deep analysis, intuition, or strategic thinking. Psychology, research, investigation, strategy consulting, or healing work all suit Snake energy. They're also natural at fields requiring sophistication like art curation or luxury goods.

They need work that engages their mind and allows for depth. Surface-level or purely social work feels empty. They prefer working independently or in small, trusted teams rather than large, chaotic organizations.

The key career satisfaction for Snakes comes from mastery and depth. They want to become true experts, to understand things at profound levels. Recognition matters less than the satisfaction of deep knowledge.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Snakes often involves learning to balance wisdom with openness. The lesson is that being wise doesn't require being hidden, that vulnerability can coexist with depth. True wisdom sometimes means sharing, not just knowing.

Releasing jealousy and possessiveness is another key lesson. Snakes must learn that love doesn't require control, that trust is stronger than surveillance. This requires healing deep insecurities about worthiness.

There's also a lesson around transformation. Snakes understand change intellectually but may resist it emotionally. Learning to shed old skins willingly, to embrace transformation rather than cling to the familiar, is core growth work.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Snake years are times of deep transformation and strategic planning. The energy supports inner work, developing wisdom, and moving forward with careful strategy. It's a year for depth over breadth, quality over quantity.

For those born in Snake years, the 12-year zodiac cycle brings opportunities for profound transformation. Every 12 years offers a chance to shed old skins and emerge renewed.`,
        
        compatibility: `Snakes find natural harmony with Oxen and Roosters - together they form a triangle of dedication and refinement. Ox provides stability, Rooster the standards, and Snake the depth and intuition.

Dragons can be fascinating partners, providing the yang energy to balance the Snake's yin. Monkeys offer mental stimulation, though their lightheartedness might sometimes frustrate the serious Snake.

Challenging matches include Tigers (too bold and direct versus the strategic Snake) and Pigs (too naive and open versus the guarded Snake). Horses might seem too restless and superficial.`,
        
        affirmation: "I am wise and open. My depth is strength, and my vulnerability is courage. I trust in transformation and release the need to control. I am both mysterious and authentic."

        hook: "Born in the Year of the Horse, this soul carries the energy of the wild stallion - free-spirited, energetic, and born to run. Horses represent freedom, adventure, and the pure joy of movement and life.",
        coreNature: `The Horse embodies the archetype of the untamed wanderer. This is freedom as a core value, energy that cannot be contained, and a spirit that wilts in captivity. Horses need room to run, both literally and metaphorically.

There's a warmth and enthusiasm that makes Horses naturally attractive. They bring energy to any situation, enthusiasm for life that's contagious. Their optimism and vitality lift others' spirits and create exciting possibilities.

The Horse soul came here to demonstrate the importance of freedom and authenticity. They're living proof that life should be an adventure, that following your heart matters more than following rules, and that sometimes the journey truly is more important than the destination.`,
        
        strengths: `Horses possess boundless energy and enthusiasm. They approach life with genuine excitement and can inspire others with their optimism. Their vitality is remarkable - they can work hard, play hard, and still have energy left over.

There's a natural warmth and friendliness. Horses are easy to like, with an open, honest manner that puts people at ease. They're genuinely interested in others and create connections easily. Their social circle is typically wide and diverse.

Adaptability is another Horse strength. They're comfortable with change, new situations, and unexpected developments. Their ability to go with the flow and find adventure in uncertainty serves them well in unpredictable circumstances.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Horse energy manifests as restlessness and commitment issues. That love of freedom can become an inability to stick with anything or anyone when the initial excitement fades. They may have a pattern of starting things enthusiastically and abandoning them when they get boring.

Impatience is a constant challenge. Horses want immediate results and can give up on things that require sustained effort. They may interrupt others or rush through important details in their eagerness to move forward.

Self-centeredness can emerge. Horses can get so focused on their own needs for freedom and excitement that they neglect others' needs or fail to consider how their choices impact people who depend on them.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Horses are passionate and exciting. They bring adventure, energy, and genuine warmth to partnerships. Romance with a Horse is never boring - there's always something new, some adventure planned, some excitement brewing.

However, Horses need independence within relationships. They can't tolerate controlling or jealous partners. They require space to pursue their interests and maintain their friendships. Relationships must enhance their freedom, not restrict it.

As parents or family members, Horses are fun and encouraging. They teach independence and adventurousness. They may struggle with routine caregiving or providing steady structure, preferring to be the exciting parent rather than the responsible one.`,
        
        career: `Horses excel in careers involving travel, variety, or independence. Sales, tourism, athletics, entertainment, or entrepreneurship all suit Horse energy. They need roles where they can move around, meet new people, and avoid routine.

The corporate world can feel like a cage unless they're in dynamic, fast-paced roles. They struggle with bureaucracy, routine, or micro-management. They need autonomy and variety to thrive professionally.

The key career satisfaction for Horses comes from freedom and variety. They need to feel unconfined, to have new challenges regularly, and to have autonomy over their schedule and methods. Monotony is soul-death.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Horses often involves learning to balance freedom with commitment. The lesson is that true freedom includes the ability to choose commitment, that running away from everything isn't actually freedom.

Developing patience and persistence is another key lesson. Horses need to learn that some of life's best experiences require sustained effort, that not everything worth doing provides immediate gratification.

There's also a lesson around depth versus breadth. Horses can be so busy experiencing everything that they don't experience anything deeply. Learning to go deep occasionally, to stick with something past the exciting beginning, creates richness.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Horse years are times of movement, travel, and new adventures. The energy supports change, pursuing freedom, and trying new things. It's a year to be active, explore, and follow your enthusiasm. Progress comes through motion.

Goats can be good partners, appreciating the Horse's warmth while providing some grounding. Dragons offer the excitement and magnitude that Horses enjoy.

Challenging matches include Rats (too calculating and strategic for the spontaneous Horse) and Oxen (too slow and routine-bound versus the freedom-loving Horse). Roosters might seem too critical and demanding.`,

        coreNature: `The Goat embodies the archetype of the peaceful artist. This is creativity flowing from sensitivity, beauty created from genuine feeling, and kindness as a natural expression rather than a strategy. Goats see the world through aesthetic and emotional lenses.

There's an inherent gentleness that's both strength and vulnerability. Goats approach life with an open heart, believing in goodness and beauty. This can make them seem naive, but it's actually a sophisticated form of hope and intention.

The Goat soul came here to demonstrate that gentleness and creativity are valuable contributions to the world. They're living proof that not everyone needs to be a warrior, that beauty and compassion have their own power.`,
        
        strengths: `Goats possess genuine creativity and artistic sensibility. They see beauty where others see ordinariness and can create art from everyday materials. Whether in traditional arts or creative problem-solving, their imaginative gifts are real.

There's a natural kindness and empathy. Goats truly care about others' well-being and will go out of their way to help or provide comfort. This creates warm, loving relationships and makes them valued community members.

Peacefulness is another Goat strength. They create calm, harmonious environments wherever they go. Their presence is soothing, and they have a gift for diffusing tension and finding peaceful solutions.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Goat energy manifests as excessive dependency and indecision. That gentle nature can become an inability to function independently or make decisions without extensive input and reassurance from others.

Over-sensitivity creates problems. Goats can be so easily hurt that they spend excessive energy avoiding anything potentially unpleasant. This can lead to withdrawal from challenges or important confrontations.

Pessimism can plague Goats. Despite their love of beauty, many struggle with negative thinking or worry. They can imagine all the things that might go wrong, becoming paralyzed by worst-case scenarios.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Goats are devoted and romantic. They create beautiful partnerships full of warmth and creativity. Romance with a Goat is gentle and nurturing - they excel at creating emotional intimacy and beauty in everyday life.

However, Goats need security and support. They do best with strong, protective partners who can provide structure and decisiveness. They need to feel safe to fully blossom in relationships.

As parents or family members, Goats are nurturing and creative. They create warm, beautiful homes and are attentive to emotional needs. They may struggle with discipline or providing tough love when needed.`,
        
        career: `Goats excel in creative fields, helping professions, or roles involving beauty and harmony. Art, design, counseling, nursing, education, or hospitality all suit Goat energy. They need work that feels meaningful and allows for creative expression.

Highly competitive or cutthroat environments are toxic for Goats. They need supportive, collaborative workplaces with clear expectations and kind leadership. They can be very productive when they feel safe and appreciated.

The key career satisfaction for Goats comes from creating beauty, helping others, or working in peaceful, harmonious environments. They need to feel their work contributes something good to the world.`,
        
        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Goats often involves developing confidence and independence. The lesson is that they have inner strength even if it doesn't look like conventional strength, that their gentleness comes from choice not weakness.

Learning to make decisions and trust their own judgment is another key lesson. Goats must develop faith in their own perceptions and the courage to choose even when uncertain.

There's also a lesson around embracing challenges. Goats naturally avoid difficulty, but growth requires moving through discomfort. Learning that they can handle hard things, that they're more resilient than they think, is transformative.`,
        
        lifeCycles: `Goat years are times of peace, creativity, and gentle progress. The energy supports artistic pursuits, relationship building, and creating beauty. It's a year for compassion and harmony rather than competition and conflict.

For those born in Goat years, the 12-year zodiac cycle brings opportunities for creative renewal and finding peace. Every 12 years offers a chance to return to their artistic nature and release worry.`,
        
        compatibility: `Goats find natural harmony with Rabbits and Pigs - together they form a triangle of peace and creativity. Rabbit provides diplomacy and refinement, Pig the warmth and generosity, and Goat the artistic vision.

Horses can be good partners, providing the energy and protection Goats need while appreciating their gentleness. Dragons might provide exciting protection though could be overwhelming.

Challenging matches include Oxen (too demanding and critical for the sensitive Goat) and Dogs (too cynical and pessimistic, amplifying the Goat's own worries). Rats might seem too opportunistic and hard-edged.`,
        
        affirmation: "I am gentle and strong. My sensitivity is wisdom. I trust my own judgment and face challenges with courage. My creativity and kindness are valuable gifts to the world."

        coreNature: `The Monkey embodies the archetype of the creative problem-solver. This is intelligence that's playful, curiosity that's insatiable, and cleverness that finds unconventional solutions. Monkeys approach life as an interesting puzzle to be solved.

There's a quality of mischief that's intrinsic to Monkey energy. They enjoy outsmarting problems and people, finding clever shortcuts, and proving that the rules don't always apply. This isn't malicious; it's simply how their quick minds work.

The Monkey soul came here to demonstrate that playfulness and intelligence go together, that not everything needs to be serious, and that sometimes the clever, unexpected solution is better than the obvious one.`,
        
        strengths: `Monkeys possess remarkable intelligence and creativity. Their minds work quickly, making connections others miss and seeing solutions that aren't obvious. They excel at innovation, problem-solving, and thinking outside conventional boxes.

There's a natural charm and wit. Monkeys are entertaining, fun to be around, and socially adept. They know how to work a room, tell a story, and make people laugh. Their playfulness is endearing and creates easy connections.

Adaptability is another Monkey strength. They can adjust to new situations quickly, learn new skills easily, and pivot when plans change. Their versatility makes them valuable in changing environments.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Monkey energy manifests as trickiness that crosses into manipulation. That clever mind can be used to deceive or take advantage. Monkeys may lie, cheat, or bend rules in ways that harm trust.

Restlessness is a constant challenge. Monkeys bore easily and may abandon projects, relationships, or commitments when the novelty wears off. Their quick minds need constant stimulation, which can prevent depth or mastery.

Arrogance can emerge. Monkeys can become so impressed with their own cleverness that they condescend to others or take foolish risks because they think they're too smart to fail.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Monkeys are fun and stimulating. They bring playfulness, wit, and excitement to partnerships. Romance with a Monkey is never boring - there's always something interesting happening, some new idea or adventure.

        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Monkeys often involves learning integrity alongside intelligence. The lesson is that being clever doesn't justify being dishonest, that true wisdom includes ethics.

Developing depth and commitment is another key lesson. Monkeys need to learn that some of life's best experiences require staying with something past the exciting beginning, that mastery requires sustained focus.

There's also a lesson around emotional availability. Monkeys can live so much in their heads that they disconnect from their hearts. Learning to feel deeply, to be vulnerable, to connect emotionally is transformative.`,

        compatibility: `Monkeys find natural harmony with Rats and Dragons - together they form a triangle of intelligence and ambition. Rat provides strategy, Dragon the vision, and Monkey the creative solutions.

Snakes can be fascinating partners, providing depth to balance the Monkey's playfulness. Oxen might provide stability, though the Monkey's restlessness could frustrate.

Challenging matches include Tigers (too straightforward and serious for the tricky Monkey) and Pigs (too sincere and trusting, making it too easy for Monkeys to manipulate). Horses might seem too scattered even for the versatile Monkey.`,

        coreNature: `The Rooster embodies the archetype of the diligent perfectionist. This is attention to detail personified, standards that refuse to be lowered, and the confidence to present oneself boldly. Roosters notice what others miss and aren't afraid to point it out.

There's a natural pride that's both strength and challenge. Roosters take genuine pride in their appearance, their work, and their accomplishments. This drives excellence but can also create pressure and judgment.

The Rooster soul came here to demonstrate the value of high standards, honest observation, and the courage to maintain excellence even when it's easier to slide into mediocrity. They're living proof that details matter.`,

        shadows: `The shadow side of Rooster energy manifests as excessive criticism and perfectionism. That keen eye that spots flaws can become harsh judgment of self and others. Roosters can be impossible to please, always finding something wrong.

Boastfulness is a real issue. Roosters can talk too much about their accomplishments or abilities, coming across as arrogant even when they're simply proud. The line between healthy confidence and off-putting bragging can blur.

Inflexibility creates problems. Roosters often believe their way is the right way and resist other approaches. They can be rigid about standards, methods, or beliefs in ways that prevent growth or collaboration.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Roosters are loyal and honest. They bring reliability, clear communication, and genuine commitment. Romance with a Rooster means knowing where you stand - they're direct about their feelings and expectations.

        coreNature: `The Dog embodies the archetype of the faithful guardian. This is loyalty made flesh, integrity as a core value, and a protective instinct that extends to all they consider their pack. Dogs are fundamentally good-hearted.

There's an innate sense of right and wrong that guides Dogs. They have strong moral compasses and aren't comfortable compromising their values, even when it's costly. This integrity makes them trustworthy but can also create inner conflict.

The Dog soul came here to demonstrate the power of loyalty, the importance of standing up for what's right, and the value of being someone others can truly count on. They're living proof that honor and reliability matter.`,

There's genuine honesty and straightforwardness. Dogs tell the truth even when it's uncomfortable. They value authenticity and have low tolerance for deception or pretense. This creates relationships built on solid foundations.

Protective instincts are strong. Dogs naturally stand up for the underdog, defend loved ones, and fight for justice. They're brave in defense of others even when they might be anxious in other contexts.`,
        
        shadows: `The shadow side of Dog energy manifests as excessive anxiety and worry. That protective instinct can become catastrophizing, imagining all the terrible things that might happen. This can create paralysis or unnecessary stress.

Pessimism plagues many Dogs. They can focus so much on what might go wrong that they struggle to enjoy what's right. Their keen awareness of injustice and danger can make it hard to relax or trust.

Stubbornness is a real issue. Once Dogs have decided what's right, they can be inflexible. They may resist new information or perspectives that challenge their established views. Their strong values can become rigidity.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Dogs are devoted and protective. They bring loyalty, honesty, and genuine commitment. Romance with a Dog means having a true partner who will stand by you through difficulties and always have your back.

They do well in roles with clear moral frameworks and opportunities to make a difference. They struggle in ethically ambiguous or cutthroat competitive environments. Their integrity isn't for sale.

        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Dogs often involves learning to balance vigilance with trust. The lesson is that being protective doesn't require constant anxiety, that sometimes you can let your guard down without catastrophe.

Developing optimism is another key lesson. Dogs need to learn to see the good alongside the bad, to trust in positive possibilities rather than always expecting the worst. This doesn't mean naivety; it means balanced perspective.

Over-indulgence is a real challenge. Pigs can struggle with excess - eating, spending, or consuming too much of anything pleasurable. Their love of abundance can cross into lack of discipline or self-control.

Materialism can emerge. Pigs' appreciation for nice things can become too focused on acquisition and possessions as measures of success or happiness. The joy of simple abundance can morph into luxury dependence.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, Pigs are devoted and generous. They bring warmth, loyalty, and genuine affection. Romance with a Pig is comfortable and abundant - they create cozy homes, plan special experiences, and make partners feel truly cared for.

        spiritualPath: `The spiritual journey for Pigs often involves learning discernment alongside generosity. The lesson is that giving wisely is more loving than giving indiscriminately, that protecting yourself allows you to give more sustainably.

Developing discipline is another key lesson. Pigs need to learn that self-control enhances rather than restricts pleasure, that delayed gratification creates richer experiences. Moderation is growth.

There's also a lesson around seeing shadow in self and others. Pigs can be so focused on goodness that they ignore or excuse harmful behavior. Learning to see clearly while maintaining kindness is transformative.`,

People shaped by Wood tend to be genuinely creative, not in a forced or performative way, but in the way a vine finds sunlight — naturally, persistently, and often from unexpected angles. They're drawn to growth in all its forms: personal development, education, building something from nothing. There's an idealism here too, a belief that things can be better, that people can evolve, that the future holds more than the past. They collaborate instinctively, understanding that a forest is stronger than a single tree. And like bamboo, they combine flexibility with surprising strength — they'll bend with circumstances rather than snap, but make no mistake about their resilience.`,
        
        gifts: "Wood element enhances creativity, ethical leadership, and the ability to envision things that don't yet exist and then actually build them. These individuals often become innovators, teachers, or leaders in fields that demand both vision and follow-through.",
        
        challenges: "The shadow side of Wood shows up as over-idealism — expecting too much too fast, spreading energy across too many projects, or becoming genuinely frustrated when reality doesn't match the vision. There can be a tendency to keep planting new seeds without tending what's already growing.",
        
        relationships: "In relationships, Wood energy shows up as investment. These aren't people who coast — they actively nurture the partnership, encourage their partner's growth, and think about where things are heading. The challenge is remembering that not every relationship needs to be a project. Sometimes just being together is enough.",
        
        career: "Wood energy thrives in education, innovation, development, environmental work, or anything that involves building something meaningful from the ground up. They're the ones who see potential in empty lots and struggling startups alike.",
        
        spiritualPath: "The spiritual lesson for Wood is learning when to stop growing outward and start growing inward. Not every direction needs to be explored. Sometimes the wisest growth is the kind you can't see — roots going deeper rather than branches reaching higher.",
        
        affirmation: "I grow wisely and sustainably. My expansion serves the greater good."

    Fire: {
        title: "Fire Element",
        nature: "Passion & Transformation",
        influence: `The Fire element charges this soul with summer's intensity — heat, light, and the power to transform whatever it touches. Fire people don't enter rooms, they change the temperature. There's a natural magnetism here, a warmth that draws others in and an energy that can feel almost electric.

People shaped by Fire tend to be genuinely passionate rather than merely enthusiastic. They feel things at full volume and aren't particularly interested in turning it down. They make decisions quickly, often from the gut, and they'd rather course-correct at speed than deliberate at a standstill. There's a dramatic quality to their emotional life — not drama for its own sake, but the kind of intensity that makes moments memorable. When a Fire person loves something, you know it. When they're angry, everyone in the building knows it. They're natural catalysts, the ones who walk into stagnant situations and somehow get things moving again.`,
        
        gifts: "Fire element amplifies leadership, the ability to inspire without trying too hard, and the raw power to transform stuck situations. These individuals often become leaders, performers, or the person everyone calls when something needs to change yesterday.",
        
        challenges: "Fire's shadow is burnout, plain and simple. That incredible intensity isn't always sustainable. There can be impulsiveness — acting before thinking, burning bridges that took years to build, or consuming resources (emotional and otherwise) faster than they can be replenished. Not every situation needs the full blaze.",
        
        relationships: "Fire brings passion and intensity to partnerships in ways that can be both thrilling and exhausting. They love hard and fight hard. The key is finding someone who can match that energy without feeding the flames, or someone whose cooler temperament provides balance without dampening the spark entirely.",
        
        career: "Fire energy excels in high-visibility leadership, performance, entrepreneurship, emergency services, or any field where charisma and decisive action matter more than careful deliberation. They're the ones who thrive under pressure that would crush others.",
        
        spiritualPath: "The spiritual journey for Fire is learning that controlled burns are more powerful than wildfires. Intensity channeled with awareness transforms. Intensity without awareness just destroys. The lesson is sustaining the flame, not just igniting it.",
        
        affirmation: "I channel my passion wisely. My intensity transforms with purpose."

    Earth: {
        title: "Earth Element",
        nature: "Stability & Nourishment",
        influence: `The Earth element grounds this soul with the energy of the harvest — patient, reliable, and deeply connected to what's real and tangible. Earth people are the bedrock others build their lives on, often without fully appreciating it until the ground shakes and the Earth person is still standing.

People shaped by Earth tend to be practical in a way that goes beyond mere common sense — they have an instinct for what works, what lasts, and what's worth the effort. They're naturally nurturing, the ones who remember to ask if you've eaten, who show up with exactly what's needed without being asked. Patience isn't something they practice; it's how they're wired. They work steadily rather than in bursts, and the results tend to outlast everyone else's. There's a deep appreciation for physical reality here — good food, comfortable spaces, the satisfaction of holding something you built with your own hands.`,
        
        gifts: "Earth element enhances dependability, the ability to turn abstract plans into concrete results, and a natural talent for making others feel safe and supported. These are the people who actually finish what they start.",
        
        challenges: "Earth's shadow shows up as stubbornness that gets mistaken for strength, resistance to change that gets called 'being realistic,' and a tendency to get so focused on material security that the soul's needs go unmet. The ground doesn't move easily, and sometimes that's exactly the problem.",
        
        relationships: "In relationships, Earth energy means showing up. Consistently. These aren't the partners who sweep you off your feet with grand gestures — they're the ones who are still there at 3am when life falls apart, making tea and saying very little but meaning everything. The risk is becoming so comfortable that the relationship stops growing.",
        
        career: "Earth energy thrives in anything requiring sustained effort and tangible outcomes — healthcare, construction, agriculture, administration, cooking, or any craft where patience and precision produce something real. They build careers the way they build everything else: brick by brick.",
        
        spiritualPath: "The spiritual lesson for Earth is learning that change isn't the enemy. The ground needs to shift sometimes for new things to grow. Letting go of control, trusting the unseen, and accepting that not everything valuable can be held in your hands — these are Earth's deeper assignments.",
        
        affirmation: "I am both stable and flexible. My grounding supports growth."
    },
    
    Metal: {
        title: "Metal Element",
        nature: "Precision & Clarity",
        influence: `The Metal element sharpens this soul with autumn's energy — the time of harvest, distillation, and cutting away what's no longer needed. Metal people see clearly where others see fog. They have standards, and those standards aren't negotiable.

People shaped by Metal tend to be precise in everything they do, from how they communicate to how they organize their lives. There's nothing vague about them. They say what they mean, they mean what they say, and they have little patience for people who can't do the same. Quality matters to them — they'd rather have one excellent thing than ten mediocre ones. They're natural organizers, the ones who walk into chaos and somehow have it sorted before lunch. And they're discerning in a way that can look like judgment but is really just clarity — they can tell the difference between what's valuable and what's just shiny.`,
        
        gifts: "Metal element sharpens perception, elevates craftsmanship, and brings the kind of clarity that cuts through confusion like a blade through silk. These individuals set the standard that others aspire to, often without trying.",
        
        challenges: "Metal's shadow is rigidity dressed up as high standards. The same precision that produces excellence can also produce a person who is impossible to please — including themselves. Emotional coldness, excessive criticism, and the inability to accept 'good enough' can isolate Metal energy from the very people who admire it.",
        
        relationships: "In relationships, Metal energy brings clarity and directness. You always know where you stand. The challenge is that emotional messiness is part of love, and Metal's instinct to clean it up or cut it away can make partners feel like they're being audited rather than loved. Learning that some imperfections are features, not bugs, is Metal's relationship homework.",
        
        career: "Metal energy excels in surgery, engineering, editing, law, accounting, fine craftsmanship, or any field where precision isn't optional. They produce work of exceptional quality and hold themselves and their colleagues to standards that elevate everything.",
        
        spiritualPath: "The spiritual lesson for Metal is learning that the sharpest blade knows when to stay in its sheath. Not everything needs to be refined. Not every flaw needs fixing. The deepest wisdom Metal can reach is accepting imperfection as part of the design, not a failure of quality control.",
        
        affirmation: "I maintain high standards while accepting imperfection. My clarity serves compassion."
    },
    
    Water: {
        title: "Water Element",
        nature: "Flow & Wisdom",
        influence: `The Water element deepens this soul with winter's energy — still on the surface, vast underneath, and more powerful than anything that tries to stop it. Water people carry a kind of ancient knowing, as though they've been here before and remember more than they let on.

People shaped by Water tend to be adaptable in ways that can look effortless but aren't. They read rooms the way rivers read landscapes — finding the path of least resistance while never losing their essential nature. Their intuition runs deep enough to be unsettling sometimes, picking up on currents and undercurrents that others miss entirely. They're comfortable with complexity, with ambiguity, with the spaces between certainties where most people feel lost. Emotions aren't something Water people manage — emotions are their element, their medium, the thing they navigate as naturally as breathing.`,
        
        gifts: "Water element enhances intuition, emotional intelligence, and the ability to navigate situations that would drown less adaptable souls. These individuals often become healers, artists, counsellors, or the person everyone confides in without quite knowing why.",
        
        challenges: "Water's shadow is losing yourself. Without boundaries, Water spreads until there's nothing left — absorbing everyone else's emotions, adapting so completely that the original self disappears, or retreating into depths where no one can follow. Fear can become the dominant current, and excessive caution can prevent the very flow that makes Water powerful.",
        
        relationships: "In relationships, Water energy connects at levels most people don't even know exist. They feel their partner's moods before words are spoken. The risk is over-merging — becoming so attuned to the other person that their own needs become invisible. Healthy Water relationships require the container of boundaries, not to restrict the flow, but to give it shape.",
        
        career: "Water energy thrives in counselling, healing arts, creative work, diplomacy, research, or any field where reading between the lines matters more than reading the lines themselves. They excel wherever emotional intelligence is the real skill being tested.",
        
        spiritualPath: "The spiritual lesson for Water is learning that depth doesn't require drowning. Boundaries aren't walls — they're riverbanks, and without them, even the mightiest river becomes a swamp. The wisdom Water seeks is already inside, waiting to be still enough to hear it.",
        
        affirmation: "I flow wisely. My depth is strength, and my boundaries are healthy."
